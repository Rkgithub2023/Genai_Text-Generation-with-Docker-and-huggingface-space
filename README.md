# Project Name
Text to Text Generation using Dockers
## Project Summary

This project leverages **FastAPI** to build a high-performance web application for serving natural language processing (NLP) models **google/flan-t5-small**. It integrates the **Hugging Face Transformers** library to utilize pre-trained models for tasks such as text classification, summarization, or sentiment analysis.

Additionally, the app is hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, providing a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the model. The application is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring easy deployment and scalability across different environments.

### Key Technologies:
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pre-trained NLP models for various language tasks.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Hosting platform for sharing machine learning demos.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.

## Features
- Fast and efficient REST API endpoints for NLP tasks.
- Pre-trained Hugging Face models for quick experimentation.
- Dockerized setup for seamless deployment.
